## Why I was been **banned/kicked/muted**?

Most likely, you violated [Discord guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) или [our Discord rules]({{%relref "discord/rules" %}}).

## How I can be **unbanned**?

You might argue the ban or prove there is no violation with **ZwerOxotnik#7117 on Discord**.

## Is there another option for removing the penalty for a violation?

There is a one, you must prepare and tell an informative lecture to our community on the ZwerOxotnik's UC server without violations. Again, first, contact with **ZwerOxotnik#7117 on Discord** and your apply will be subjectively reviewed.

## Can I apply for a moderator?

Nobody can provide it to you as a service, we don't need to look for moderators.
