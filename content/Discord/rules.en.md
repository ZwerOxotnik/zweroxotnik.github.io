The server rules generally match the [Discord guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) by a principle: "the severity of a violation together with social behavior leads to appropriate punishment within the community"

The rules are short and subjective in social conflicts. Moderators keep order without inflated rights, although auto-moderation bot is enough in many cases. Just in case, contact with: ZwerOxotnik#7117

However, we cannot use "A Code of Conduct" to the full (For instance ["Contributor Covenant"](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ru/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) because of different goals of groups of people. I personally consider that such things make it difficult to socialize in a new environment.
